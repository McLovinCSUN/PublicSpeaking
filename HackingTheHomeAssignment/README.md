# Hacking The Home Assignment
**Leveling Up when you don't have the XP**

## Workshop for Junior Developers

Home assignments are here to stay as they offer less biased views and are more focused on the quality of your work.

Unfortunately, if you’re a Junior Developer, the quality of work is usually what stands out. Your projects won’t look like what a professional reviewer is used to: They may be messy, half-working, or lacking documentation and instructions.

Workshop participants will learn an organized system for working on a small project while presenting best-practices. That means passing more interview steps, more options to choose from, and more bargaining power for your next job.

### Requirements
* **Bring your own laptop and development environment**. There will be some coding involved, make sure you’re all set-up, because we wouldn’t want to lose any time over it.
* **This workshop is backend oriented, but language agnostic** - You can use Python, NodeJS, Java - Whatever you’re comfortable with. This is not the time to experiment with new languages. The code won’t be the issue here.
* **How proficient should you be?** If you can write and understand what’s going on in a small web-server tutorial (i.e. Flask for Python, builtin HTTP for Node, Spring Bootstrap for Java).
* **Install Docker and make sure it’s running**.
